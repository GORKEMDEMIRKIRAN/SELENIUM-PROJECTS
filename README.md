PYTHON SELENIUM

In my thesis, I need information about the distance and time between two points more than 550 thousand.
Dec. The distance between these points Decoupled and I obtained distance and duration information using 
python selenium to get the information. Because there are so many points, I have reduced this process to
about half an hour using the api. In this project, only python draws data by connecting to maps with selenium.
